```
The maximum value for UInt32 is 0xFFFFFFFF (or 4294967295 in decimal).

sizeof(UInt32) would not return the maximum value; it would return 4, the size in bytes of a 32 bit unsigned integer.
```

##
```
4.294.967.295 is the maximal value or in hexadecimal 0xFFFFFFFF
```

##
```
let myMax: UInt32 = 0xFFFFFFFF

if myOtherNumber > myMax {
    // resolve problem
}
```
